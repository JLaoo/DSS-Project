# DSS-Project

Spring 2019 Data Science Society General Member Project

titanic2 - Cleaned Data, ran initial ML tests

DSS CRUISE - User Interface + Final ML implementation

Based off of tutorial found here: https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-the-survival-of-titanic-passengers-30870ccc7e8

Done with 3 other group members.

Personal Contributions:
1) Implemented algorithm to fill in missing ages based on title
2) Implemented and debugged Machine Learning algorithms
3) Debugged titanic2 code as a whole
4) Debugged and updated user interface and quiz implementation
5) Implemented machine learning algorithm in the quiz

# Project Abstract

Using the titanic dataset from Kaggle, our group cleaned and interpolated data in order to build a machine learning model that could accurately predict whether or not a person would survive the titanic given several attributes such as wealth, sex, age, etc. The final project was framed in a more modern context for the sake of presentation.
